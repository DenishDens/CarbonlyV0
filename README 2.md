## Data Flow

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Users sign up/login through Supabase Auth
   - Session management via AuthProvider context
   - Protected routes handled by middleware

2. **Emission Data Flow**:
   - Data input through file uploads or manual entry
   - AI processing for document extraction
   - Storage in Supabase database
   - Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions

3. **Organization Structure**:
   - Organizations can have multiple projects
   - Projects can be individual or joint ventures
   - Team members have role-based permissions
